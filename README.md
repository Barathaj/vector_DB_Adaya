# Vector Database Search Tool -  Adaya.ai

## Objective :

The Vector Database Search Tool is designed to efficiently store and retrieve high-dimensional data, such as image embeddings or word vectors. The primary objective of this tool is to create a basic search tool that enables users to input a product name and retrieve the most similar product names along with their details from the database.

**Project Overview :**
The project involves the following tasks:

1. Generating 512-dimensional vectors for the "Product Name" column using TF-IDF technique.
2. Implementing a vector database using Pinecone, a cloud-based service known for its speed and scalability.
3. Developing a method to add documents and index vectors in the database, including the "Product Name," "MRP" (Maximum Retail Price), and "Short Description."
4. Creating a user interface where users can input a product name query and retrieve the top 10 most similar product names and their details.
5. Documenting the procedure, including the methodology used, and presenting the results obtained.

**Advantages of Django:**
- ***Full-Featured Framework:***
   Django provides a wide range of built-in features for web development, including authentication, admin interface, and ORM (Object-Relational Mapping).
- ***High-Level Abstraction:***
  Django abstracts away many complexities of web development, allowing developers to focus on application logic rather than boilerplate code.
- ***Robust Ecosystem:***
   Django has a vast ecosystem of libraries and packages, making it easy to integrate additional functionality into the application.

**Conclusion:**
The Vector Database Search Tool is a powerful solution for efficiently storing and retrieving high-dimensional data. By leveraging technologies like Pinecone for vector storage and Django for web development, the tool offers fast and scalable search capabilities with a user-friendly interface. With its ability to retrieve the most similar product names based on user queries, the tool facilitates efficient data exploration and decision-making.
